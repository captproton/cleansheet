Feature: Import csv docs
  In order to import information from external files, prticularly Comma-Separated Value files where rows appear on each line and columns within each row have comma delimiters
  As a database maintainer
  I want to select columns (and rows) from the CSV files and merge these to create other new pieces of information.
